# Arch Linux Simple Installer
This is a simple installation script for Arch Linux. It's aimed to be minimalistic and reduce stress of disk changing or machine hopping.

Execute this command from live ISO: curl路--location路"https://git.io/fluffeh-archsin"路|路/bin/bash

***

This script is suitable for both workstations and servers. Consider using a different disk layout ( manual partitioning ) for servers. I will be uploading a few other options at some point in the future.

For the moment it is a BTRFS only install.


To-Do's:

- [ ] Add support for MBR installation
- [ ] Add support for more filesystems
- [ ] Add multiple variants for disk layouting
- ...
